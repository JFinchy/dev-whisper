# Signal sidebar Settings, theme picker & widget flyout

Branch: `JFinchy/greenling`
Files changed: `src-tauri/src/theme.rs` (new), `src-tauri/src/config.rs`,
`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src-tauri/src/recording.rs`, `src/theme.ts` (new),
`src/SettingsView.tsx`, `src/WidgetView.tsx`, `src/App.css`

(Supersedes the now-deleted `signal-chain-settings.md` — same underlying
feature set, but Settings ended up as a left sidebar, not the pipeline
nodes that file described. See commit history for the earlier version if
you want to compare.)

## What to verify

Three related changes, all UI-facing:

1. Settings is restructured from one flat 520px scrolling column into a
   left sidebar (Dictation, Voice, Vocabulary, Modes, LLM, History,
   Integrations, plus Appearance/Advanced in the footer) with a single
   page of content on the right — instead of everything stacked in one
   long scroll. The window is now 880×720 (min 760×560) instead of
   520×680. **History is its own top-level sidebar item**, not nested
   under anything else.
2. A 4-way color theme picker (Terminal/Signal/Quiet/Palette) lives on
   the Appearance page, defaults to Terminal, persists across restarts,
   and updates the widget's accent color live via a `theme-changed` event
   without restarting either window.
3. The floating widget's compact mode grows a hover flyout below the pill
   with two real, wired controls: Mic Mode (Standard/Voice Isolation —
   same backend field as the Settings > Voice toggle) and a one-shot
   "next dictation" mode override (Plain/Casual/CLI) that takes priority
   over the auto-detected app-mode for exactly one dictation, then clears
   itself.

Automated coverage: `cargo test --lib` (80 tests, including `theme::tests`
and the updated `config::tests` round-trip) and `bun run build` (tsc +
vite) both pass, but nothing automated drives the actual window resize,
sidebar navigation, the live theme swap, or hovering the real floating
widget — that's what this pass is for.

## Steps

### Sidebar layout
1. From repo root: `bun run tauri dev`. Look for the mic icon in the menu
   bar (not a window).
2. Tray icon → **Open Settings…**. Confirm the window opens noticeably
   wider than before, with a left sidebar (Dev Whisper wordmark at top,
   7 nav items, Appearance/Advanced below a divider at the bottom).
3. Click through every sidebar item and confirm each shows the right
   settings and that everything that used to work still works:
   - **Dictation** → Launch at login + Widget style, Microphone device
     picker, push-to-talk shortcut capture.
   - **Voice** → Whisper model list (download/activate), Voice Isolation
     toggle.
   - **Vocabulary** → term chips (add/remove).
   - **Modes** → app rules list (add/edit/remove, per-rule model + LLM
     refinement toggle).
   - **LLM** → Ollama model catalog (download/activate, latency).
   - **History** → transcript list, retention picker, work journal toggle,
     per-entry copy/delete. Confirm this is reachable directly from the
     sidebar, not buried inside another page.
   - **Integrations** → Copy-only toggle, Output webhook (URL + test
     send).
   - **Appearance** (footer) → theme picker, see below.
   - **Advanced** (footer) → Logs (expand/refresh/clear).
4. Confirm the previously-active page stays highlighted in the sidebar
   while you're on it, and switching pages doesn't lose anything you'd
   typed elsewhere (e.g. a half-typed vocabulary term).

### Theme picker
5. On **Appearance**, click through all four themes (Terminal → Signal →
   Quiet → Palette). Confirm the sidebar's active-item color and the
   page's accent color change immediately, and the selected row shows a
   checkmark.
6. Quit and relaunch the app (or just reopen Settings) — confirm the last
   theme picked is still selected (persisted, not reset to Terminal).
7. With Settings open, glance at the floating widget while switching
   themes in step 5 — its recording-dot glow and gear-hover color should
   update live (the widget stays dark-glass; only the accent shifts).

### Widget hover flyout
8. Make sure the widget is in **Compact** mode (Dictation page → Widget
   style).
9. Hover the mouse over the floating widget pill (don't click). Confirm it
   grows downward to reveal "Mic mode" (Standard/Voice Isolation) and
   "Next dictation" (Plain/Casual/CLI) rows, and shrinks back to normal
   when the mouse leaves.
10. Click "Voice Isolation" in the flyout, then open Settings → Voice and
    confirm the Voice Isolation toggle is now on (same underlying
    setting, driven from two places).
11. Hover the widget again, click "CLI" under Next dictation. Trigger a
    dictation in an app that would normally resolve to Plain or Casual
    (e.g. dictate into TextEdit or Notes) and say something like "git
    commit update readme". Confirm it pastes as
    `git commit -m "update readme"` (CLI formatting), even though TextEdit
    isn't a CLI app.
12. Hover the widget again afterward — confirm "Next dictation" is back to
    no selection (the override is one-shot and clears itself after use).
13. Hover the widget, click "CLI" again to select it, then click "CLI" a
    second time — confirm it deselects (click-to-clear before ever
    recording), and a subsequent dictation uses the normal auto-detected
    mode.

## Pass criteria

All of steps 3-7 and 9-13 behave as described. Nothing that worked in the
old flat Settings layout should be missing or broken in the new one —
this is a restructure, not a feature cut. History in particular must be
reachable in one click from the sidebar.
