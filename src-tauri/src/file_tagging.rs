/// File tagging, from the Smart Formatting parity backlog item (see
/// BACKLOG.md — this piece was filed separately from the rest since it's
/// really a variant of the deferred "selected-text/on-screen context"
/// work, not a punctuation command).
///
/// Wispr Flow's version works because Cursor/Windsurf are apps they have
/// a deep hook into — they can query the project's real file index and
/// insert a UI-native reference chip. Dev Whisper has neither of those:
/// it only ever knows the frontmost app's bundle ID, and delivery is
/// always a blind simulated-paste of plain text. So this can't work the
/// same way for a windowed editor.
///
/// It *can* work for terminal-based coding agents, though — Claude Code,
/// OpenCode, and Gemini CLI all accept a literal `@path/to/file` typed
/// straight into their prompt and do their own fuzzy file resolution
/// from there. We don't need a project file index at all: just recognize
/// a token that's *shaped* like a bare filename (identifier + `.` +
/// known extension) in CLI-mode dictation and prefix it with `@`, and
/// let the agent do the rest.
///
/// Scoped to CLI mode only (wired into `modes::format_as_cli`'s fallback
/// branch, not its literal shell-command directives like `git commit` —
/// tagging a file mention inside an actual commit message would corrupt
/// it). Known limitations, both accepted rather than solved:
/// - Bare filenames only, no paths — spoken "src slash lib dot rs" isn't
///   reliably reconstructable through the existing punctuation pipeline
///   (`extract_word` doesn't have a "dot" command, so a spoken path
///   doesn't glue into one taggable token the way `~/`, `src/lib` etc.
///   do for punctuation-only text). This relies on Whisper's own
///   transcription already rendering a spoken filename like "recording
///   dot r_s" as literal `recording.rs`, which it usually does — it's
///   trained on plenty of code-adjacent text.
/// - No project awareness — this tags anything *shaped* like a file, real
///   or not. If it doesn't exist, the agent's own file resolution just
///   won't find a match, same as if you'd mistyped an `@mention` yourself.
